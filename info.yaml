# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Count up to 9,change at clock edge"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a set of registers and combinational to divide the clock, and then some combinational logic
      to convert from binary to decimal for the display.

      With all the inputs set to 0, the internal 8 bit compare is set to 1. This means the
      counter will increment by 20MHz.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, select the select input line for division.
      See does the clock changes accordingly.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
